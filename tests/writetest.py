# There are 16 registers on the Max7219

#Itâ€™s then a matter of sending commands to the Max7219 via the data in, clock and load line.

#For instance, to display the number 4 on digit 1 we would send the command 0x104 (0x01 : use
#digit 1, 0x04 : display the number 4). Which might look something like this :

#     Set LOAD to 1
#     Send 16 bits command and data (0x104 = 0000000100000100), and for each binary digit we
#         set CLOCK to 0
#         send the binary digit
#         set CLOCK to 1.
#     Set LOAD to 0 then set LOAD to 1.

#At this point it might be worth mentioning that the Max7219 can work in two modes, BCD decode on or BCD decode off.
